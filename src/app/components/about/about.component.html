  <h1>What is this</h1>
  <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
    This is NekoHit Project. A project let you support other's project using the bleeding
    edge blockchain technology. It looks like Pateron, but it's a better version of Pateron,
    on Neo N3 blockchain.

  <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
    If you're a content creator, then you can create a WCA for your current project.
    By supplying some details information about your project, if everything is ok, then
    your WCA detail will be stored on blockchain. For each WCA, we split it into multiple
    milestones, so creator can have a better control on their project. For each milestone,
    beyond basic title and description, you have to specify a deadline. You have to finish
    those milestones before their deadline, with a link to your work, otherwise you will be
    punished (see next paragraph).
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
    Then you should stake some CAT token to your WCA, this is decided by you when you are
    creating a WCA: A higher stake rate means you will lose more if you don't finish your
    milestones on time, what you lose is part of token you staked, and this will be
    distributed to your supporters, based on how much they supported you. Thus you can
    gain trust by staking higher rate and finished your project one time. But you should
    make a good plan before you create the WCA, if you cannot catch the time, you'd better
    hope your supporters can tolerate you.
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
    After you pay the stake, your WCA is available to purchase for supporters. If you
    choose to public your project when you create it, them everyone can see your WCA
    and read the details, then decide if they want to support. If you make it private,
    then you have to advertise your WCA on your self. A good description and a detailed
    plan always attract more supporters.

    Once you finished your first milestone, or
    After you pay the stake, your WCA is available to purchase for supporters. If you
    choose to public your project when you create it, them everyone can see your WCA

  <h1>How it work</h1>

  <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
    The NekoHit Project is a blockchain application built on top of Neo N3.
    There are two part of this project: CAT token and WCA contract.
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
    The CAT token is the currency for WCA contract. It has a fixed amount of
    supply, 1 billion in total, with no change in the future. And the minimal
    unit is 0.01CAT. We are trying to make it feels like the real world currency,
    so you can feel more familiar to spend it. By supplying this amount of tokens,
    we hope we can eliminate the dramatic change of price caused by crypto currency
    market.
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
    The WCA contract is the core of NekoHit Project. It handles all requests from you.
    It will create and save your WCA to the blockchain, all your updates to your WCA
    also stored on blockchain, this means a more open and clear platform to let people
    trust you and support your project. If you are a supporter, you can trust the technology
    of blockchain, no one can tamper the data. You decide which project to support, when
    to make a refund (at any time). All those requests are processed by our WCA contract
    running on Neo N3 network automatically. If you don't trust this contract, we make it
    open sourced on <a href="https://github.com/NekoHitDev/Ritmin">GitHub</a>, so you can
    review the code and compile the contract by yourself, then check with the contract we
    deployed to see if this is trustable.
