      Welcome to the NekoHit Project - a platform built on top of NEO N3 which allows you to support projects from
      people all around the world
      using the bleeding edge blockchain technology. As a creator you can fund your "WCA" (Work Completion Agreements)
      with CAT tokens. On the other hand as a supporter you can help out your favorite content creators.
      NekoHit has specifically been designed so that both parties are taking a risk as less as possible.

      The CAT token is the currency for the WCA contract. It has a fixed amount of supply of 1 billion in total,
      with no changes planned in the future.
      The minimal unit is 0.01CAT. We are trying to make it feel like the real world currency,
      so you can feel more familiar to spend it. By supplying this amount of tokens,
      we hope we can eliminate the dramatic change of price caused by crypto currency market.

      <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
        The WCA contract is the core of NekoHit Project. It handles all requests from you.
        It will create and save your WCA to the blockchain. All of your updates to your WCA
        are also stored on the blockchain. This means a more open and clear platform to let people
        trust you and support your project.

        <p>If you are a supporter, you can trust the technology
          of blockchain, no one can tamper the data. You decide which project to support and when
          to make a refund (at any time).</p>

        All those requests are processed by our WCA contract
        running on Neo N3 network automatically. If you don't trust this contract or have any doubts then don't worry,
        we open sourced everything on <a href="https://github.com/NekoHitDev/Ritmin">GitHub</a>, so you can
        review the code and compile the contract yourself.

      If you're a content creator then you can create a WCA for your current project and store it on the
      N3 NEO blockchain. Simply provide some basic information what your project is about, set milestones
      and you can get started.
      Each WCA will be split into multiple milestones, so you can have a better control over your project which
      at the same time provides more transparency for your supporters.
      Each milestone requires a title, description and a deadline. It is important that you finish your milestones
      <b>before</b> that and provide proof to your work with a link which leads to said proof. Not finishing a milestone
      in time will have consequences. After finishing a milestone your WCA should now have the status
      <p-tag value="PENDING" severity="warning"></p-tag>
      .
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
      Your last step before your WCA becomes available for the public is staking some CAT tokens.
      The amount of tokens you will have to provide is your choice. A higher stake rate means you will lose more tokens
      if you don't finish a milestone in time. In case this happens, part of the staked tokens will
      be distributed to your supporters based on how much they initially supported you.
      <p>
        Thus you can gain trust by staking higher rates and finish your project on time. But you should
        make a good plan before you create the WCA, if you can't finish a milestone in time, you better
        hope that your supporters tolerate you. After successfully staking, your WCA has now the status
        <p-tag value="OPEN" severity="success"></p-tag>
        .
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
      After you pay the stake, your WCA is available to purchase for supporters. If you
      chose the option that your WCA will be publicly listed then everyone can see your WCA, read the details,
      and then decide if they want to support you. If you set it to private,
      then you have to advertise your WCA on your self by sharing the identifier of your WCA.
      A good description and a detailed plan always attract more supporters.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
      Once you finished your first milestone or you missed your first milestone, your
      WCA will become
      <p-tag value="ACTIVE" severity="info"></p-tag>
      , and no one can make a purchase anymore.
      At this stage you can continue your work, or early stop it (but you will lose all your unfinished
      milestones). Please do notice you have to obey your cooldown interval you set when
      you created your WCA. Once the last milestone is finished, WCA contract will
      automatically compute and transfer the tokens. At this stage, your WCA is
      <p-tag value="FINISHED" severity="danger"></p-tag>
      .

      If you are a supporter feel free to browse all kinds of WCAs. Our contract have
      users in mind when we built it. As a supporter when you decide to support some
      projects by sending tokens to their WCA, you will be displayed all details of this
      WCA before you make the purchase, you can go through those important details, like
      milestones set up, staking rate, and the most important two options which are the cool down interval
      and the threshold milestone.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph p-text-left">
      The cooldown interval is a limitation set by creator to limit how fast they can finish a
      milestone. If it's too short then it's possible to quickly finish all milestones and
      take away the tokens and you won't have time to notice this. With some reasonable cooldown
      interval a creator must wait this amount of time before finishing the next milestone. If
      anything goes wrong, you will have time to make a refund. Don't forget, you can
      make a refund anytime, as long as the WCA isn't finished.
